# filter-news

In this assignment, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. I used  Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from another site.

Whenever a user visits the site, the app should scrape stories from a local ABC online news site here in Austin and display the headline, a picture, and the url for each article. Each scraped article is saved to the application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article.

# npm-Packages:

express

express-handlebars

mongoose

body-parser

cheerio

request
